    description: "Audiophile Store offers an extensive selection of hi-fi equipment, interconnect cables, accessories and A/V Power solutions that can be purchased conveniently online or direct from the Melbourne Australia Warehouse. So what makes us different? Often finding myself frustrated with high prices and limited selection of Hi- fi cables and DIY parts in Australia I began A.L.A Audio(Audio Cable Manufacturer) and shortly there after Audiophile Store both owned and operated by myself, a passionate audio enthusiast.Following in my family footsteps, involved in speaker design and manufacture; skilled in electrical engineering and with 15 years experience in Business and Logistics Management.After opening our AU warehouse I focused on developing solid relationships with a now large network of suppliers, transport providers and distribution partners across Australia, China, Europe, Japan, USA.We now air - freight weekly bulk shipments to replenish our warehouse ensuring stock is always available while keeping prices low and offering free shipping!Catering to the needs of customers who are interested in high - resolution streaming and digital music technologies, making available industry leading digital sound technology to the Australian market, my continuing endeavour is to drive down costs, by selling direct I eliminate the retail price mark ups traditionally seen in the hi-fi industry, and by bulk buying; negotiating deals with leading suppliers; and most importantly in taking the time to talk to my customers to understand exactly what you want. Some of the products available in store include Speakers, Headphones, DAC D / A Converters, Network Streamers, Amplifiers, Headphone Amplifiers and Portable Audio accessories.Media players, Interconnect Cables, Power Cords, Conditioners and Filters, Adaptors, Networking accessories, DIY Audio and more.",
